    <h3>Introduction to Saturn</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system. Known for its stunning ring system, Saturn is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium. It is one of the most iconic planets due to its rings, which can be seen even through small telescopes.
    </p>

    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 120,536 km (about 9.5 times the diameter of Earth)</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 5.683 × 10<sup>26</sup> kg (95 times more massive than Earth)</li>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Primarily hydrogen and helium, similar to Jupiter.</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Saturn’s atmosphere contains bands of clouds and features storms, but they are less visible than Jupiter's.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Saturn's Ring System</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn’s rings are made of ice particles, dust, and rocky debris. The rings are vast but extremely thin, spanning over 282,000 km in diameter but only about 20 meters thick. They are divided into several groups, with the most prominent being the A, B, and C rings. The origin of these rings is still debated, but they remain one of the most recognizable features of any planet in our solar system.

    <h3>Saturn's Moons</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn has at least 83 moons, with Titan being the largest and one of the most interesting in the solar system. Titan is larger than the planet Mercury and has a dense atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen. Another intriguing moon is Enceladus, which has geysers that shoot water vapor into space, hinting at an ocean beneath its icy surface.

    <h3>Interesting Facts About Saturn</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Saturn is the least dense planet in the solar system; if there were a large enough body of water, it would float.</li>
        <li>Saturn’s winds are incredibly fast, reaching speeds of up to 1,800 km/h in its upper atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Like Jupiter, Saturn emits more energy than it receives from the Sun, likely due to helium rain within its atmosphere.</li>
        <li>Saturn's rings are not solid; they are made up of countless small particles, some as tiny as dust grains and others as large as mountains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploration of Saturn</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn has been explored by several spacecraft, including Pioneer 11, Voyager 1 and 2, and most notably the Cassini mission. Cassini, which orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017, provided detailed images and data about Saturn, its rings, and its moons, revolutionizing our understanding of the planet.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Saturn’s beauty and complexity make it one of the most fascinating planets in our solar system. With its majestic rings, numerous moons, and intriguing atmosphere, Saturn continues to captivate both scientists and space enthusiasts alike.
