    <h3>Introduction to Jupiter</h3>
    <p>
        Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is known for its massive size and swirling cloud bands. It is the fifth planet from the Sun and is primarily made up of hydrogen and helium, similar to a star. With its prominent rings and numerous moons, Jupiter has fascinated astronomers for centuries.
    </p>

    <h3>Physical Characteristics</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Diameter:</strong> 142,984 km (almost 11 times the diameter of Earth)</li>
        <li><strong>Mass:</strong> 1.898 × 10<sup>27</sup> kg (318 times more massive than Earth)</li>
        <li><strong>Composition:</strong> Mostly hydrogen and helium, with small amounts of methane, water vapor, ammonia, and other gases.</li>
        <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Jupiter's atmosphere is known for its swirling storms, the most famous of which is the Great Red Spot, a storm larger than Earth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Great Red Spot</h3>
    <p>
        One of the most notable features of Jupiter is the Great Red Spot. This gigantic storm has been raging for at least 350 years, possibly even longer. It is a high-pressure system that produces powerful winds and is about 1.3 times the diameter of Earth.
    </p>

    <h3>Jupiter's Moons</h3>
    <p>
        Jupiter has 79 known moons, the largest of which are the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are some of the most intriguing celestial objects in our solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system, even larger than the planet Mercury.

    <h3>Interesting Facts About Jupiter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Jupiter is the fastest spinning planet in the solar system, with a day lasting only about 10 hours.</li>
        <li>The planet has a faint ring system, composed mostly of dust particles from its moons.</li>
        <li>Jupiter has a strong magnetic field, about 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s.</li>
        <li>Jupiter emits more heat than it receives from the Sun due to the heat generated by its internal processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Exploration of Jupiter</h3>
    <p>
        Numerous spacecraft have visited Jupiter, including the Pioneer and Voyager missions. The Galileo spacecraft orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, providing detailed information about the planet and its moons. Currently, NASA’s Juno mission is studying the planet’s atmosphere, magnetic field, and more to gain deeper insights into its structure and origin.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        Jupiter is a gas giant that dominates our solar system with its sheer size and complexity. Its storms, moons, and rings make it an incredibly interesting planet to study, and continued exploration promises to reveal more secrets of this majestic giant.
